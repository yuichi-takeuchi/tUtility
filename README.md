# tUtility
This procedure (tUtility) offers the GUI (control panel) for general purpose analyses with necessory library.
This is written by Yuichi Takeuchi PhD and mainly used for analyses and figure preparation of in vitro patch-clamp recordings.
But it can be utilized for other analyses including in vivo intra- and extracellular recordings, calcium imagings etc.

This code has been tested in Igor Pro version 6.3.7.2. for Windows and supposed to work in Igor Pro 6.1 or later.

Dependency:

Several functions depend on the following libraries.
1. PPT.XOP (http://www.mpibpc.mpg.de/groups/neher/index.php?page=software)
2. SetWindowExt.XOP (http://fermi.uchicago.edu/freeware/LoomisWood/SetWindowExt.shtml)

How to install:
1. Install Igor Pro 6.1 or later.
2. Put GlobalProcedure.ipf or its shortcut into the Igor Procedures folder, which is normally located at My Documents\WaveMetrics\Igor Pro 6 User Files\Igor Procedures.
3. Optional: Put PPT.xop and SetWindowExt.xop or their shortcuts into the Igor Extensions folder, which is normally located at My Documents\WaveMetrics\Igor Pro 6 User Files\Igor Extensions.
4. Optional: Put PPT Help.ihf and SetWindowExt Help.ipf or their shortcuts into the Igor Help Files folder, which is normally located at My Documents\WaveMetrics\Igor Pro 6 User Files\Igor Help Files.
